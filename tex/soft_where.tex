\section*{INTRODUCTION}

I work lately primarily with cellular automata (both continuous and discrete ) and symmetric cryptosystems. I think of the algorithms themselves as art (or perhaps as industrial design), and I often use the algorithms to create art in the more typical sense. This pdf is something like a directory to my current, featured projects. I provide a link to more information and source code at the bottom of each entry.	

\section*{Thorium}

This symmetric cryptosystem uses a square matrix of bits as a key. The rows and columns are \q{circular shifted,} so that the matrix is topologically a torus (not exactly but \i{somewhat} like Rubik's Cube.)  \b{Cesium}, just below, includes \b{Thorium} as a special case, but I keep \b{Thorium} separate because I hope to implement it in assembly, and the base 2 version came first.

\section*{Cesium}

This system is generalization of \b{Thorium} to an arbitrary base.  It's easy to just use base 27 (the alphabet and an underscore), so that one can exchange messages in right away in English. I hope to write up a version in Javascript so that I can provide the encoder on a static website for actual use. I teach math, and I'd like to give my students an example of a complex but still invertible function.

\section*{Cone}

This symmetric cryptosystem is based on a triangular implementation of a ternary elementary cellular automata. The key is  27 ternary symbols which represent a rule for a ternary cellular automaton with a neighborhood size of $3$. The rule is then also used as a seed (along with a symbol of plaintext) in order to get the ciphertext symbol.
